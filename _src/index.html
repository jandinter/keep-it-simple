          We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
        </p>
        <p>
          Permission to use content you create and share: You own the content you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services, though, we need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license is only for the purpose of making our Products available to you. This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Facebook Products you use.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can end this license any time by deleting your content or account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies (though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and they have not deleted it.

          Eventbrite is not the creator, organizer or owner of the events listed on the Services. Rather, Eventbrite provides its Services, which allow Organizers to manage ticketing and registration and promote their events. The Organizer is solely responsible for ensuring that any page displaying an event on the Services (and the event itself) meet all applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations, and that the goods and services described on the event page are delivered as described and in an accurate satisfactory manner. The Organizer of a paid event selects the payment processing method for its event as more fully described in the Merchant Agreement. Consumers must use whatever payment processing method the Organizer selects. If the Organizer selects a payment processing method that uses a third party to process the payment, then neither Eventbrite nor any of its payment processing partners processes the transaction but we transmit the Consumer's payment details to the Organizer's designated payment provider. If an Organizer uses Eventbrite Payment Processing (as defined in the Merchant Agreement), Eventbrite also acts as the Organizer's limited agent solely for the purpose of using our third party payment service providers to collect payments made by Consumers on the Services and passing such payments to the Organizer.
