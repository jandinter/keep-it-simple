# Capture the essence of a long text by explaining it in your own words

Demo for the Berlin Legal Hackathon 2019: We all come across long texts, for example when we are faced with privacy policies or terms and conditions. While there is nothing wrong with clearly communicating the legal requirements and expectations, it is nice to have a short summary which allows a site visitor to scan the text.

It can be quite difficult to write a short summary. Marc Twain famously said: "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead." However, when we *talk* to someone else, we can often explain a difficult concept in simple words. That's where Keep It Simple helps you: You have to explain a text block in your own words first. After you have talked about the content, your spoken words are transformed into text by speech recognition. Only then can you edit this summary with the keyboard.

## How it works

Click on the microphone button and speak about the paragraph, like you would talk to a co-worker or friend. Your explanation will be transformed into written text which you can edit afterwards.

When you use Keep It Simple for the first time, it will likely ask you for permission to use the microphone. Obviously, this is required for the speech recognition.

Speech recognition is currently done on Google servers. Due to limited support for this feature, Keep It Simple currently works in [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) browsers only.

## Why it matters

### Your users’ time is precious. 

Don’t waste your users’ time by having them read lengthy texts, like privacy policies or terms and conditions. With Keep It Simple, you can offer a short summary for the clauses very easily. Your users can grasp the outline of the text very quickly – they will appreciate it!

### Accesibility

Using a screen reader makes it hard to “scan” a long text. With short summaries, you make your website more accessible.
